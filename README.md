## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Ionicons

### What I learned
In this project I learnt where to find and how to use free icons

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.js"></script>
```
Learnt about shadows
```css
box-shadow: 0px 5px 10px hsl(257, 40%, 20%);
```
And learnt how to combine links and icons
```css
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/"><ion-icon name="logo-facebook"></ion-icon></a>
<a href="https://twitter.com"><ion-icon name="logo-twitter"></ion-icon></a>
<a href="http://instagram.com"><ion-icon name="logo-instagram"></ion-icon></a>
```
### Continued development

I'd like to get better with image with flexbox sizes, I still kinda don't know how to properly make them work together.
